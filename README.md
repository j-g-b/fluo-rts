# fluo-rts

This repository contains scripts for RTS estimation of sources of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) using fluorescence spectroscopy data as described in the article [Routine Estimation of Dissolved Organic Matter Sources Using Fluorescence Data and Linear Least Squares](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acsestwater.2c00605). The source EEMs described in the article may be downloaded from this [figshare link](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Source_Excitation-Emission_Matrices_EEMs_/23150642). 

An interactive version of these scripts, which allows users to upload their files to a cloud-based computing environment can be found at the [RTS Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1leJod1-ji2GT5mebkTzsz-Pj7LrPToKl).

# fluo-rts

This repository contains scripts for RTS estimation of sources of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) using fluorescence spectroscopy data. An interactive version of these scripts, which allows users to upload their files to a cloud-based computing environment can be found at the [RTS Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1leJod1-ji2GT5mebkTzsz-Pj7LrPToKl).
